The presentation includes animations and visual explanations of the MCP evolution from first principles.

### 1  Why this repo exists

This repository is the companion for a 45-minute talk (+15 Q\&A) that walks engineers from "one-off AWS demo" to "fully-fledged protocol (MCP)".
Each git branch represents a chapter in that story; the code is illustrative, but the **learning happens in the journey between branches**.

### 2  How to follow along during the talk

*If you want the gritty implementation details, open the matching prompt file or branch.*

### 4  Running the demos live

1. **Open the presentation**: Start with the [live slides](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/abhisheksp/mcp-first-principles/blob/main/slides/slides.html) for the visual narrative
2. **Check out the branch for the phase you're discussing.**
3. `mvn test -q` to run the illustrative JUnit scenarios; they log rich console output.
4. Use `git diff` between phases to *show, not tell* how design pressure drives refactors.

> **Speaker tip**: The slides and code work together - use slides to explain concepts, then switch to the terminal to show the actual implementation evolving through the branches.

### 5  About the Claude.ai prompts

Toward the end of **Phase 5** the Claude chat hit the token-limit wall. The prompt in *Phase-5-prompt.md* contains minor manual edits where context had to be re-introduced before continuing.&#x20;
