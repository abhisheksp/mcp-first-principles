## Our Story: WatchTower.AI

You're the lead engineer at a hot startup that just raised Series A funding for your innovative log monitoring service.

- **Traction**: Customers love the AI-powered analysis
- **Problem**: Big customers want multi-cloud support

## The Journey We'll Take Today

1. **Start** with working AWS integration
2. **Feel the pain** when adding GCP support
3. **Refactor** naturally toward better abstractions
4. **Discover** we've essentially built MCP
5. **Understand** why protocols beat APIs for AI tools

## Why This Matters

- Every AI tool faces this integration problem
- MCP is emerging as the standard solution
- Understanding the "why" makes adoption obvious

## The Core Agent Loop

```
User Query → Agent → LLM decides what data needed
                 ↓
         Fetch from cloud sources
                 ↓
         LLM analyzes with context
                 ↓
         Return insights to user
```

**Key Insight**: The LLM needs to know what tools are available!
