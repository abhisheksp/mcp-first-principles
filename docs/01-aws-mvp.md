# Phase 1: AWS MVP Success

## What We Built

Direct AWS CloudWatch integration with error troubleshooting:
- **Single Feature**: Root cause analysis for errors
- **Single Cloud**: AWS CloudWatch only
- **Single Use Case**: Payment service errors

## Demo: See It In Action

Run: `./demo.sh`

Notice how we get intelligent analysis of AWS CloudWatch logs.

## The Implementation

```java
// Everything is hardcoded to AWS
private final AWSCloudWatchFake awsClient;

// Direct client usage - no abstraction
List<LogEntry> logs = awsClient.filterLogEvents(
    "/aws/payment-service",  // Hardcoded!
    "ERROR",
    1000
);

// Single Feature: Root cause analysis
public String troubleshootErrors(String userQuery)

// Authentication is the first thing!
Map<String, String> awsCredentials = new HashMap<>();
awsCredentials.put("accessKeyId", System.getenv("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"));
awsCredentials.put("secretAccessKey", System.getenv("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"));
awsCredentials.put("region", "us-east-1");
```

## What's Working

- ✓ Simple, focused implementation
- ✓ Proper AWS authentication pattern
- ✓ Great for AWS-only customers
- ✓ Solves the immediate pain point
- ✓ Fast time to market

## Customer Feedback

> "This is great! Can you also generate daily summaries?"
> 
> "We love it! But we need GCP support too..."
> 
> "Perfect for AWS, but what about our Azure workloads?"

## The Problems Starting to Surface

- ✗ Only troubleshooting - no other analysis types
- ✗ AWS credentials hardcoded in constructor
- ✗ Different clouds = different auth patterns
- ✗ Everything hardcoded to AWS
- ✗ No way for the agent to know what's available
