     * OUR PROTOCOL                          MCP (Model Context Protocol)
     * ============                          ============================
     * 
     * Transport: TCP (demo)                 Transport: stdio/SSE
     * Format: JSON-RPC 2.0                  Format: JSON-RPC 2.0
     * 
     * Methods:                              Methods:
     * - initialize    →                     - initialize
     * - discover      →                     - tools/list
     * - execute       →                     - tools/call
     * 
     * Lifecycle:                            Lifecycle:
     * 1. Connect                            1. Connect
     * 2. Initialize                         2. Initialize  
     * 3. Discover capabilities              3. List tools
     * 4. Execute functions                  4. Call tools
     * 
     * Multi-Source Support:                 Multi-Source Support:
     * - Agent connects to multiple servers  - Client connects to multiple servers
     * - Namespaced functions (AWS.*, GCP.*) - Namespaced tools by server
     * - LLM orchestrates across all sources - LLM orchestrates across all tools
     * - Function discovery from all sources - Tool discovery from all servers
     * 
     * Benefits:                             Benefits:
     * - One protocol for all sources        - One protocol for all tools
     * - LLMs understand the format          - LLMs understand the format
     * - No transport multiplication         - No API multiplication
     * - Language agnostic                   - Language agnostic
     * - Complete decoupling                 - Complete decoupling
     * - Multi-source orchestration         - Multi-tool orchestration
     * 
     * Key Insight: We built MCP from first principles!
     * 
     * By solving real problems:
     * 1. Multi-cloud support (Phase 3) → Multiple tool sources
     * 2. LLM orchestration (Phase 4) → Function/tool calling
     * 3. Transport chaos (Phase 5) → Standardized protocol
     * 4. Universal access (Phase 6) → Multi-source protocol
     * 
     * We naturally arrived at the MCP architecture!
