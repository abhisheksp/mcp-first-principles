## Anomaly Detection Report - Traffic Pattern Analysis

**Alert Summary:**
Unusual traffic spike detected requiring immediate attention.

**Anomaly Details:**
1. **Traffic Volume**
   - Baseline: 1,000 requests/minute
   - Current: 5,000 requests/minute
   - Increase: 500% (5x normal traffic)
   - Duration: Ongoing for 12 minutes

2. **Traffic Characteristics**
   - Source: Single IP address (185.220.101.45)
   - User-Agent: Identical across all requests
   - Request Pattern: Sequential API endpoints
   - Geographic Location: TOR exit node

3. **Behavioral Analysis**
   - No authentication attempts
   - Targeting public endpoints only
   - High request rate: 83 req/sec from single source
   - No normal user interaction patterns

**Risk Assessment: HIGH**
- Potential DDoS attack in progress
- Resource exhaustion risk
- May be reconnaissance for vulnerabilities
- Could impact legitimate user traffic

**Similar Historical Patterns:**
- 2024-01-05: Bot scraping attempt (blocked)
- 2023-12-20: DDoS attack from botnet
- 2023-11-15: Vulnerability scanner detected

**Recommended Actions:**
1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Block IP address 185.220.101.45
   - Enable rate limiting (10 req/min per IP)
   - Activate DDoS protection mode

2. **Investigation Steps:**
   - Check for data exfiltration attempts
   - Review access logs for other suspicious IPs
   - Analyze request payloads for injection attempts

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Implement CAPTCHA for high-rate requests
   - Deploy geographic rate limiting
   - Consider implementing proof-of-work challenges

**Impact Assessment:**
- Current system load: 73% CPU
- Response time degradation: +200ms
- Error rate increase: 1.2%
- Affected users: ~5% experiencing slowness
