## Payment API Failure Analysis

**Root Cause Identified:**
The payment API failures are occurring due to a cascading failure pattern:

1. **Database Connection Pool Exhaustion**
   - Current pool size: 100 connections (all active, 0 idle)
   - Queries are taking longer than usual, holding connections
   - Connection wait time exceeding configured timeout

2. **Resulting Timeouts**
   - API requests timing out after 30 seconds
   - Upstream services receiving 500 errors
   - Circuit breaker has opened to prevent further damage

3. **Memory Pressure**
   - OutOfMemoryError detected in recent logs
   - Queue depth at 1500 messages indicates backpressure
   - Heap dumps show large object retention

**Timeline of Events:**
- 12:00 - First timeout detected (tx-12345)
- 12:01 - Connection pool exhausted warning
- 12:02 - Latency spike (p99=5000ms)
- 12:05 - Circuit breaker opened
- 12:07 - OutOfMemoryError thrown

**Recommendations:**
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Increase connection pool size to 200
   - Restart affected instances to clear memory
   - Enable connection pool metrics monitoring

2. **Short-term Fixes:**
   - Implement circuit breaker pattern across all services
   - Add connection timeout and retry logic
   - Configure automatic heap dump on OOM

3. **Long-term Solutions:**
   - Investigate slow queries causing connection holds
   - Implement database read replicas for scaling
   - Add horizontal pod autoscaling based on memory
